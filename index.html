                    <h2>Hello and welcome to my portfolio page! <br>My name is Cynthia Weaver.</h2>
                    <p>I am a former English Language Arts teacher who recently made the move
                        from Lakeland, Florida to Asheville, North Carolina. I have a Bachelor of Arts in
                        Music and English from The University of Alabama, and I am working towards a Master of Science
                        degree in Learning Design and Technology in an online program at the University of South
                        Florida. Currently, I am studying
                        software development at Thinkful.</p>

                <p>While I loved my previous career as a teacher, I realized that my passion lies
                    in technology and its ability to positively impact the world. As a result, I made
                    the decision to transition to a career in software development, and I am thoroughly
                    enjoying my journey so far.</p>

            <div>
                <p> When I'm not busy coding, I enjoy exploring the great outdoors through hiking and backpacking.
                    Living in Asheville, I am fortunate to have access to some of the most beautiful trails and
                    scenery in the United States, and I make it a priority to get out and enjoy them as often as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. If you have any questions or are
                    interested in working together, please don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
